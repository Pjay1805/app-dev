But dark forces stir in the shadows, threatening a fragile equilibrium. When the precious suitcase disappears, Newt is thrown into a world of chaos and intrigue, as the malevolent actions of infamous wizard Gellert Grindelwald cause untold destruction on the busy 5th Avenue. Now, the stakes are higher than ever before. With the mystical animals still on the loose and the city's fate hanging by a thread, who knows what will happen to the wizarding and non-magic worlds and Newt's fantastic beasts?  |
